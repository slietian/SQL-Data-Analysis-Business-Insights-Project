# SQL Data Analysis & Business Insights Project

## Overview
This project focuses on solving real-world business problems using SQL. The objective is to analyze structured datasets, extract meaningful insights, and present results in a clear, business-oriented manner. The project emphasizes analytical thinking, query logic, and interpretation of data rather than just writing SQL syntax.

This work is based on selected case studies from the public **8 Week SQL Challenge**, solved independently with custom explanations and insights.

## Objectives
- Analyze business datasets using SQL queries
- Perform data cleaning, aggregation, and filtering
- Answer business-driven questions using data
- Generate actionable insights for decision-making
- Strengthen problem-solving and analytical skills

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible)
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code / Any SQL Editor

## Dataset Source
Datasets used in this project are sourced from the public repository:

https://github.com/DataWithDanny/8-Week-SQL-Challenge

Each dataset represents a real-world business scenario such as customer transactions, sales performance, and operational analysis.

## Case Studies Covered
- Customer purchase behavior analysis
- Sales performance and trend analysis
- Product-level and customer-level insights
- Business rule validation using SQL logic

## Approach
1. Understand the business problem statement
2. Explore dataset structure and relationships
3. Write optimized SQL queries
4. Use joins, aggregations, and conditional logic
5. Interpret query results
6. Document insights clearly

## Key Insights
- Identified high-value customers based on frequency and spending patterns
- Analyzed product performance across different time periods
- Discovered trends useful for customer retention strategies
- Highlighted key metrics relevant for business decisions

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Import the dataset into your SQL environment
3. Open the SQL files and execute queries step by step
4. Review query outputs and documented insights

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved SQL querying and optimization skills
- Better understanding of business-oriented data analysis
- Experience translating data into meaningful insights
- Practical exposure to real-world analytical problem solving
